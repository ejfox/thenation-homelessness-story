On September 29, a tiny pumpkin sat next to Amber Coughtry’s and Billy Lewnes’ white cross, in a gravel parking lot by Force Lake in Portland. “Gone 2 years” was written on it.

Two years to the day after the pair were killed, birds chirped above an interstate freeway’s roar, golf carts scudded, geese splashed and a dog cavorted on the dashboard of an RV with no license plates. History hung heavy: this spot was home to School Number 3, part of a wartime public housing city named Vanport, which floodwaters washed away in 1948. In 1983, a serial killer dumped a teen girl’s body in a nearby slough.

Coughtry’s mother Laurie Bushnell comes to the place to deposit jars of  homemade dill pickles. It’s her way of working through grief, and limbo.

“She liked just dill pickles,” Bushnell says of Coughtry — who, as a toddler, would drink juice right from the jar. “It had to be dill pickles. She’d be at the refrigerator going, ‘Pickles! Pickles!’” 

Later, Coughtry “spiraled” with depression and drugs, Bushnell says. Residing in vehicles, she and Lewnes survived an RV fire. Then, in a brutal, still-unsolved double homicide, they were shot to death in their car before sunrise. Three days later, Portland Police announced there was “no threat to the community.” The crime faded, popping up in a report and local stories. 

Yet these are dots in a line that’s pointing ever higher. 

Murders of unhoused people in the United States have been rising since 2010, a sample of medical examiner data from 17 large metro areas shows. Los Angeles Police Department data shows the rate of homeless homicides has also ramped up this decade — the total for this decade’s three years exceeds all of last decade’s — and experts say violence against homeless people is now surging nationally. Unhoused people are two or three times as likely to be victims as suspects, LAPD data shows — and if we remove homeless-on-homeless homicides to focus on “stranger danger” cases, the ratio is greater than three to one.

Experts say this is what happens when housing unaffordability and indifference towards people experiencing homelessness meet an historic surge in homicides. 

“You have an epidemic of homelessness and living outside, and an epidemic of gun violence,” says Barbara DiPietro, senior policy director for the National Health Care for the Homeless Council. “No one should be surprised to see that this is increasing. We throw vulnerable people to the wolves every day.”

The trend is complex because it brings together two issues — homelessness and homicides — that are polarized battlegrounds. In the long term, it likely reflects a burgeoning U.S. homeless population that Brian Davis, Director of Grassroots Organizing at the National Coalition for the Homeless says is higher than it’s been since Great Depression shantytowns.

The short-term surge this decade is related to the pandemic. Davis says Covid-19 left people like Coughtry and Lewnes facing a “horrible choice” between mean streets and packed shelters.

“Do you risk your life on the streets,” Davis asks, “or in a room with 50 or 400 other people?” 

In March 2020, Lewnes posted on Facebook, “They say not to be around groups of 10 or more. I know, let’s cram everybody into a shelter. Wtf. The safest places are parks with lots of trees.”


## Experts point to the trend’s economic and psychological roots.

In a 2020 report, Davis’ coalition found a statistical correlation between the 2007-2008 Great Recession and cresting anti-homeless violence. It’s happening again, pushed by economic jolts like inflation. Mental illness is also on the rise.

“People are more depressed; they’re more worried,” DiPietro says. “A nation on edge is going to have more murders.”

After a 2020-2021 halt in encampment sweeps based on C.D.C. guidance coincided with a “significant decline in attacks” on unhoused people, Davis says, cities are now sweeping sites in an unprecedented 66 U.S. cities.

Such actions often occur in partnership with law enforcement, which for DiPietro highlights a tension. How, she asks, can police “be two things,” both “pulling down tents” and investigating homeless people’s deaths? “If you dehumanize people, how is it that you take their deaths seriously?”

The scarcity of data on homelessness amongst law enforcement agencies is changing, albeit slowly. While the stalled George Floyd Justice in Policing Act called for and California is considering requiring tracking, a recent federal research grant, a Dept. of Justice spokesperson clarifies, will merely “guide further research.”

Like Portland’s and most forces, the NYPD doesn’t actively track this and so says it needs five months to share data. The LAPD is an exception. Its data show 329 “homeless homicides” (228 victims and 101 suspects) so far this decade, which is more than the previous decade’s 275 total (169 victims and 106 suspects). 

Another exception is Oregon. In a new law that appears to be the first of its kind, it’s tracking homeless mortality, including homicides, this year.

“There needs to be some standard,” Davis says. “Every community should be reporting this information.” 


As homeless homicides increase, so do uncomfortable questions. 

**Graphic on sheltered vs unsheltered in different cities**

Why, for example, are there five or six times as many in Los Angeles as in New York, even though the latter city’s homeless population is largest in the nation? Is it because New York City has a “right to shelter” law so its homeless population is 95 percent sheltered, while 70 percent of unhoused people in Los Angeles are unsheltered, i.e. living in tents or cars or other places not meant for human habitation? 

As The Nation has reported, homelessness is changing: 2020 was the first time that the official “Point in Time” homeless count report to Congress documented a majority living unsheltered. Vehicle residents like Coughtry and Lewnes comprise the fastest-growing, and perhaps most-misunderstood, subpopulation.

Another question concerns the media: why does it focus on homicides in which a homeless person kills a housed person, like Michelle Go in New York or Sandra Shells in Los Angeles, rather than the statistical majority? 

And why are so many serial killers preying upon unhoused people? Since 2010, they’ve popped up in San Diego, Baton Rouge, Atlanta, Houston, Albuquerque, Orlando, Los Angeles and probably other cities.

**Serial killer map**

DiPietro points to the nexus of our hyperviolent culture and the dehumanization brought by criminalizing homelessness.

“We have a ubiquitousness of violence generally, and as we criminalize homeless people we gradually reduce their humanity,” DiPietro says. “It’s easier to be violent to someone who’s [seen as] not fully human.” 

Earlier this year the nation’s attention turned to Gerald Brevard III, who allegedly killed sleeping homeless people in NYC and DC, then posted “feeling devilish … feeling godly,” and Miami real estate agent Willy Maceo, who allegedly pulled his Charger alongside sleeping humans and shot them. Those three cities are listed by the coalition as among the “Dirty Dozen Meanest” cities.

“If your city starts turning its back on people experiencing homelessness, it seems to give a license to people who are on the fringe and may have other issues,” Davis says. 

For grieving friends and family, the most important question is: how many of these murders are solved? The answer’s unavailable, Davis says. The data’s marginalized, like those it describes. But since only about half of all homicides are now solved, it’s almost certainly a minority.

Back at Force Lake, a couple residing in a Scion XB told me it had just been egged. Bushnell has talked to homeless people there, too, and heard rumors, but she’s trusting police to solve this. Her experience with Detective Rico Beniga and others has been “really good,” she says, but “some things are harder to solve than others.” So she grieves in private, and shares pickles with Coughtry’s daughter, who also loves them.

“Will it ever come to closure? I don’t know,” Bushnell says. “I hope it does.”
